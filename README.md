SentiHack

During the covid19, ever have issue trying to submit temperature taking and having to look for link provided by companies or for the school

In school, students were asked to record their temperature down twice a day onto a particular portal/website. The main purpose of the was to record their temperature down. 

As time passes, students would forget to submit or do not feel encourage submit because they are not incentivizes to. Sometimes, students do not submit until reminders are served to them by email or SMS. 

We want to provide an easy and interactive way to do it!

We have built a website with the idea of providing

- Weather Information

    Users would be able to use the information provided to help them decide whether to stay in or go out 

- News section

    Users can get up-to-date news, such as covid19, in Singapore and also with the ability to read the content of the news

- Nearest CHAS clinic

    This is to encourage users who are not feeling well to head to the nearest clinic of their home. The list will auto populate based on the time user 

- Uploading of previous temperature records of users

All in one web application! 

User have the ability to have their own record of temperature taking.

Any group/department/organization/school could adopt it! They could also make use of the News section to their own needs such as putting school or organization announcements.

However, due to time constraint, we have only managed to complete

- News Section with the ability to read the content of the news
- Ability to upload CSV file, convert to JSON and then display out as table

**Sentient Hackathon API Used**

- Text-To-Speech ENG
- CSV-JSON Utility

**Other 3rd Party API Used**

- News API
